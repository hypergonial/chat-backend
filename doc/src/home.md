Welcome to the documentation!

The API comprises of two main modules, the [REST API](./rest/home.md) and the [Gateway API](./gateway/home.md). The REST API is used for querying information about and modifying all [objects](./objects/home.md) the client has access to. The Gateway API is used for receiving events from the server.

> The API is still in development, and is subject to change. API routes and events may be missing, or may not work as expected. If you encounter a bug or have a suggestion, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/HyperGH/chat/issues).
